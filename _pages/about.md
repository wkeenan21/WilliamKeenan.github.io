#### For Work: I am a geographer, geospatial data scientist, and hydrologist. I use remote sensing and in situ data to study the Earth, with a focus on the hydrosphere.
#### For Fun: I love whitewater boating, backcountry skiing, and just being outside with friends and family.

I am a PhD student in Watershed Science at Colorado State University. I study how wildfire affects hydrologic regimes in mountain environments. I have a background in remote sensing and GIS and
love applying this knowledge to hydrology problems.
I am also the executive officer for the CO Army National Guard's Military Intelligence Company: D CO, 572 BEB, 86th IBCT.

Background
------
I grew up in Germantown, TN, a suburb of Memphis. From an early age, I was obsessed with natural landscapes and the maps that described them.
As soon as I was old enough to ride a bike and paddle a kayak I began exploring the neighborhoods, woods, and various waterways and drainage ditches around Memphis.
Kayaking and camping along the Mississippi River was a formative experience that made me appreciate the beauty and power of rivers.

After high school, I decided to move to the front range of Colorado. The University of Colorado Boulder provided the where, and a US Army ROTC scholarship provided the how.
There, I double majored in GIS and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology and worked as a raft guide in the summer. For the first 4 years after undergrad, I did ecological field work jobs, GIS application engineering, and deployed to Kosovo with the Army.
In 2022, I felt the pull of a research focused career and found my way back to school at the University of Denver. My time at DU has solidified my passion for science and teaching.

At Colorado State University I work with Dr. Stephanie Kampf on an interdiscplinary team of civil engineers, geoscientists, and water scientists studying post-fire hydrology.
