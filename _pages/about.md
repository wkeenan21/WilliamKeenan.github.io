Hello! About Me
======
My name is William Keenan. For Work: I am a geographer, geospatial data scientist, and hydrologist.
For Fun: I am a whitewater boater, backcountry skier, and bad Catan player.

Currently, I hold 3 part time positions.
I work at the USGS Geosciences and Environmental Change Science Center where I use remote sensing to study surface water fluctuations across the US.
I also work as a Teacher's Assistant at the University of Denver department of Geography and the Environment where I teach remote sensing and GIS classes.
Lastly, I am the Executive Officer for the CO Army National Guard's Military Intelligence Company: 86th IBCT, 572 BEB, D CO

Background
======
I grew up in Germantown, TN, a suburb of Memphis. From an early age, I was obsessed with both the natural landscape and the maps that described them.
As soon as I was old enough to ride a bike and paddle a kayak I began exploring the neighborhoods, woods, and various waterways and drainage ditches around Memphis.
Kayaking and camping along the Mississippi River was a formative experience that made me appreciate the beauty and power of rivers. 

Like most 18 - 25 year olds looking for purpose, I decided to move the front range of Colorado. The University of Colorado Boulder provided the where, and a US Army ROTC scholarship provided the how.
There, I double majored in GIS and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology and worked as a raft guide in the summers. After undergrad, I did some ecological field work jobs, GIS engineering, and deployed to Kosovo with the Army.

My next step in life will be at Colorado State University where I will pursue a PhD in Watershed Sciences.
I will be working with Dr. Stephanie Kampf on an interdiscplinary team of civil engineers, geoscientists, and water scientists studying post-fire hydrology.
