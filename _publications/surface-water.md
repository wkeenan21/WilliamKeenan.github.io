Abstract:
The retention of surface water in wetlands and lakes can modify the timing, duration, and magnitude of river discharge. However, efforts to characterize the influence of surface water on discharge regimes have been generally limited to small, wetland-dense watersheds. We developed random forest models to explain spatial variability in six hydrologic signatures, reflecting flashiness, high, and low flow conditions, at 72 gaged watersheds with variable water storage capacity across the conterminous United States. In addition to variables representing meteorology and landscape characteristics, we also tested the inclusion of surface water dynamics, derived from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. Models for all six signatures improved with the addition of catchment characteristics, including surface water dynamics, relative to models with only climate variables. Percent improvement in model adjusted R2, mean square error, and Akaike information criterion ranged from 4.00 to 14.33%, 5.00 to 20.30%, and 2.75–8.14, respectively. Automated variable selection can be indicative of the relative importance of certain variables over others. Using a forward selection process, five of the six signature models selected remotely sensed inundation or wetland variables (p < 0.05). For example, the variable semi-permanent and permanent (SP + P) floodplain inundation (i.e., lakes along rivers) was associated with lower annual flashiness. Further, SP + P non-floodplain waters and geographically isolated wetlands significantly contributed to explaining variability in the low flow signatures. Our findings underscore the capacity of wetlands to stabilize and maintain flows during dry periods. Improved understanding of how surface water dynamics influence hydrologic signatures can inform wetland restoration efforts and facilitate improved resilience to extreme flow conditions.
